Your employer has implemented a punishment system based on points, where every mistake or error in your code will result in a deduction of points. If your points drop below a certain level, you may face consequences such as a pay cut or even termination. Not continuing code during a code review or collaboration is considered a more severe mistake and results in two strikes. If you receive five strikes, you may be dismissed from your position.
